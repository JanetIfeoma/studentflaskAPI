About Student Management API
Student Management API does the main function of a school and explains how it works. It enables the school to create an admin account. It allows the registration of students and lecturers. Also, the API allows the school admin to create courses and handling the grading system for the student.

CRUD operations can be carried out on the student data and the courses data, with an easy-to-use Swagger UI setup for testing and integration with the front end.

A Student account have limited access to the app, as a student can only change their profile details and view their profile, courses, grades and GPA.

This Student Management API was built with Python's Flask-RESTX by Ajayi Oluwaseyi during Backend Engineering live classes at AltSchool Africa. This was built as my third semester final capstone project in AltSchool Africa.
